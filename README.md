scripts:

  # Define a script called "example" that can be run with "wyp run example"
  example:

    # Help text for command
    help: command with all options
  
    # Make available under "wyp [name]" vs default "wyp run [name]"
    root: true
  
    # Execute multiple scripts at once. Can not use with "run"
    combine:
      - simpleGreet
      - detailedGreet

    # Execute command. Can not use with "combine"
    run: echo "Hello World"
  
    # Define environment variables for run context
    env:
      ENV: var

    # Change the directory the command is run in
    dir: './some/other/directory'
