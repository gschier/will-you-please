## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/gschier/wyp
```

Or, download and copy the [latest release](https://github.com/gschier/wyp/releases) to your PATH.

## Getting Started

```bash
wyp init                       # Generate wyp.yaml

wyp run                        # Prompt for script to run
wyp run --watch ./dir          # Prompt and restart on file change
wyp run [name]                 # Execute script by name
wyp run [name] --watch ./dir   # Restart on file change

wyp combine [name...]          # Execute scripts in parallel
wyp combine --watch [name...]  # Execute in parallel and watch

wyp start                      # Shorthand for `wyp run start`
```

## Configuration

Configuration is defined in `wyp.yaml`. An sample config can be generated by running `wyp init`.

```yaml
# ~~~~~~~~ #
# wyp.yaml #
# ~~~~~~~~ #

# Scripts are defined in a map of [name] => [config]
scripts:

  # Define a script called "example" that can be run with "wyp run example"
  example:

    # Help text for command
    help: command with all options
  
    # Make available under "wyp [name]" vs default "wyp run [name]"
    root: true
  
    # Execute multiple scripts at once. Can not use with "run"
    combine:
      - simpleGreet
      - detailedGreet

    # Execute command. Can not use with "combine"
    run: echo "Hello World"
  
    # Define environment variables for run context
    env:
      - NAME=value
      - ANOTHER='something that needs quotes'

    # Change the directory the command is run in
    dir: './some/other/directory'

    # Hide command from help output
    hide: true

    # Select between bash/zsh/sh (default: current shell)
    shell: bash

    # Restart on file changes (recursive)
    watch: .
```
